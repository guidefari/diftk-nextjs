                  <h3>Find A Book, Help A Child</h3>
                  <p>
                    Started in 2015, FABHAC is an acronym for “FIND A BOOK HELP
                    A CHILD.” It is an initiative aimed at improving the plight
                    of children and adults living with a disability, and more
                    particularly with down-syndrome. Due to the costs involved
                    in joining libraries, many literate people living with
                    disabilties are denied the right to access books.Through
                    FABHAC, Our goal is to develop a “free” library for this
                    marginalised group of people as we are firm advocates of the
                    slogan, “Disabilty is not Inabilty.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Up to date, through generous donations from the following
                    institutions and numerous individuals, we’ve mobilised over
                    a 1000 books for the library!
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Whitestone Chapel, Byo, Zimbabwe.​</li>
                    <li>Rotaract Club of Belmont, Byo, Zimbabwe.​​</li>
                    <li>Girls College, Byo, Zimbabwe</li>
                    <li>Petra High School, Byo, Zimbabwe.​</li>
                    <li>Petra Primary School, Byo, Zimbabwe.​</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    We’d also like to thank the Zimbabwe Down-Syndrome
                    Association (ZDSA) that has availed a room that will operate
                    as the library.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However there’s several costs involved in making a library
                    operational and absolutely cost free for it’s beneficiaries.
                    It’s in this light we kindly ask for support in the form of
                    monetary donations for the cause. If you have a non-monetary
                    donation that you think may be of assistance, please contact
                    Terry Nesu (contact at footer).

                    Will Brunsdon (pictured above), is the personification of
                    “Disability is not Inability.” Will’s disability is
                    down-syndrome, and as he spoke to children from The Armidale
                    School, he shared how he’s not only risen above the
                    challenge of living with down syndrome, but persevered,
                    trained hard, and gone on to break up to 32 WORLD RECORDS in
                    various World Down Syndrome Swimming Championships! DO IT
                    FOR THE KIDS is very proud to have Will as an ambassador as
                    he wears his wristband in support of others living with down
                    syndrome half way across the globe in Zimbabwe. We commend
                    Will on showing the greatness people of all abilities are
                    capable of with the right support structure from local
                    communities and of course, personal “will” power.
